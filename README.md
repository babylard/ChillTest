# ChillTest
An application for testing the effeciency of your CPU cooler or your CPU durability.
ChillTest will preform very heavy tasks in the background, making it ideal to use this
to test your Cooler. I wouldnt reccomend doing this on lower end Laptops, as it probably
wont be cooled too well and you will just end up frying your CPU.

# WANRING
This application will put your CPU under heavy load and it is
not reccomended to run this unless you are testing your Cooling or CPU.
